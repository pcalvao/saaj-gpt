The Supreme Court ruling that New York's proper-cause requirement for citizens to demonstrate a special need for self-defense in order to carry a handgun in public violates the Second and Fourteenth Amendments emphasizes the importance of considering the Second Amendment's text and historical understanding. The Inc. v. Bruen case argues that there is a longstanding tradition of broad restrictions on public carriage of firearms in the US. However, the Supreme Court decision protects the right of law-abiding people to carry guns outside the home for self-defense. Justice Breyer dissents, arguing that the law is a reasonable regulation that is substantially related to New York's compelling interest in public safety and preventing gun violence. He suggests that the Court's decision is based on incomplete historical analysis and ignores the State's interest in preventing gun violence.
