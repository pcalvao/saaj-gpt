Abstract: The Supreme Court's opinion in the case of New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen centered on the Second Amendment's plain text and historical approach to protect an individual's right to bear arms. The court rejected the Courts of Appeals' second step, which was inconsistent with Heller's historical approach and its rejection of means-end scrutiny.

Abstract: The Supreme Court's test for assessing the constitutionality of modern firearms regulations requires an assessment of whether they are consistent with the Second Amendment's text and historical understanding. The court must rely on historical evidence to determine the meaning of constitutional text, especially text meant to codify a pre-existing right. The court must also reason by analogy to determine whether a historical regulation is a proper analogue for a modern firearm regulation.

Abstract: The text discusses antebellum state-court decisions on the public carry of arms, including Tennessee's prohibition on carrying "belt or pocket pistols," and the adoption of surety statutes that required certain individuals to post bond before carrying weapons in public. The text argues that these laws did not represent the "direct precursor" to New York's proper-cause requirement, which presumes that individuals have no public carry right without a showing of heightened need.

Abstract: The Supreme Court reviewed historical evidence from antebellum America and the Reconstruction era to determine the scope of the right to bear arms in public. The Court found that while the manner of public carry was subject to reasonable regulation, none of the historical limitations on the right to bear arms approached New York's proper-cause requirement.

Abstract: Gun violence in the US is on the rise, with the number of firearm-related deaths increasing by 25% since 2015. Gun violence is now the leading cause of death in children and adolescents, and it disproportionately affects communities of color. The dangers posed by firearms can take many forms, including mass shootings, road rage incidents, domestic disputes, and interactions with police officers. Balancing the lawful uses of guns against their dangers requires consideration of various factors, and it is the responsibility of elected bodies to regulate guns. Different types of firearms may pose different risks and serve different purposes, and the dangers and benefits posed by firearms may differ between urban and rural areas.

Abstract: The dissenting opinion in the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen case argues that the Supreme Court's criticisms of New York's concealed-carry licensing regime are unsupported by evidence due to the lack of an evidentiary record. The dissenting opinion also critiques the Court's comparison of New York's licensing regime to those of other states, arguing that the line between "may issue" and "shall issue" regimes is not as clear-cut as the Court suggests.

Abstract: Justice Breyer dissents from the Supreme Court's decision to strike down New York's concealed-carry licensing regime as a violation of the Second Amendment. He argues that the Court's reliance on history alone goes too far and that the Court should have considered New York's compelling interest in regulating the concealed carriage of handguns and whether its law is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. He also notes that the Court's tally of "may issue" and "shall issue" jurisdictions is incomplete because it only accounts for the number of states with "may issue" regimes, not the number of people governed by those regimes.

Abstract: Justice Breyer argues that relying solely on historical analysis to interpret the Constitution is difficult, and judges do not have the necessary expertise. He cites the example of the Heller case, where the Court misread the English Bill of Rights. The Court's opinion today in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen compounds the problem by giving lower courts little guidance on how to resolve modern constitutional questions based almost solely on history.

Abstract: Justice Breyer dissents in the case of New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v.

Abstract: The text discusses the Statute of Northampton, a law enacted in England in the 14th century that prohibited carrying arms without the King's permission. The law remained in force for centuries and was discussed in the works of legal scholars such as Blackstone and Coke. Several American colonies and states enacted similar restrictions modeled on the statute. The text argues that this history supports legal restrictions on the public carriage of firearms.

Abstract: Justice Breyer dissents from the Supreme Court's decision to strike down New York's law regulating the concealed carry of handguns. He argues that the law is a reasonable regulation that is substantially related to New York's compelling interest in public safety and crime prevention.
